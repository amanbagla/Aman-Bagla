## RELEVANT PROJECTS

**Identifying major factors impacting population growth rate across various geographic locations**  
_Jan 2019-May 2019_  
- Population growth trends of 173 countries analyzed over two decades in relation with different geographic, demographic, economic and sociological factors such as education, GDP, migrant stock, religion, demographic etc. to develop a region/country specific customized strategy to control population growth rate.
- Different Predictive models build using Random Forest, Boosting, GAMs, MARS, BART and SVM techniques, tuned respective parameters using K-fold cross-validation and compared RMSE values for best model selection.

**Building model to predict house sale price (R)**  
_Jan 2019-May 2019_  
- Build a model to predict sale price of house for Ames city and Iowa using 80 qualitative and quantitative predictors such as house location, facilities, neighborhood, floor area etc. and identified major factors impacting prices.
- Used different data imputation methodologies for cleaning data, build different models using different predictive modeling techniques such as BART, GBM etc and compared them using R-sqr for final model selection.

**Understanding demographics of ageing vs GDP growth rate across the world (R)**  
[Predictive Link](https://github.com/amanbagla/Aman-Bagla/blob/master/Data%20Visualization.pdf)  
_Jan 2019-May 2019_  
- Data visualization and wrangling packages like ggvis, shiny, ggplot, tidyverse, dplyr etc. used for making interactive world plots to understand the demographics of ageing and its relationship with GDP growth rate over last 5 decades.

**Identifying features of an image using Neural Network and SVM techniques (R)**  
_June 2018-Aug 2018_  
- Developed model to identify the letters in an image using SVM / Neural networks machine learning techniques.

**Modeling forest fire weather index to predict forest fire (SAS)**  
_Jan 2018-May 2018_  
- Modeled Forest Fire Weather Index using Regression/ Generalized Additive Modeling techniques to predict Forest Fire at different ambient conditions such as fuel moisture codes, fire behavior indices, wind speed, rain, temp etc.
- Used various variable selection and shrinkage methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Ridge Regression/Lasso along with box-cox variable transformation to achieve a prediction accuracy of 27.8%. 

**Containment of “Rocker Arm Fall down” cases using Linear Discrimination Analysis (R)**  
_Aug 2017-Dec 2017_  
- Build a model based on Linear Discrimination Analysis to proactively identify defective engines using cold test engine performance data and tuned model’s parameter using ROC curve to capture 97.3 % of defective cases inhouse.
